## 🎯 Business Problem

Meta campaigns were running across various geographies, demographics, and ad formats.  
The marketing team required a **unified performance tracking dashboard** that answers:

- Which campaigns/platforms perform best?
- Which audience segments drive engagement?
- What is the ROI of the current marketing spend?
- How do engagement patterns vary by time, location, gender, and age?
- Which ad formats deliver conversions efficiently?

This dashboard directly addresses these questions using multi-source performance data.
